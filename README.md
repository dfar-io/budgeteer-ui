## Getting Started

2. `F5` to run locally.

First, install:

```
curl -L https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xvz
cd codeclimate-* && sudo make install && cd ..
```

Then to run:

```
codeclimate analyze
```

## Update Packages

1. Run `ng update`, determine outdated packages.
2. Run `ng update` with the commands to update specific packages.

## Infrastructure Deployment

Terraform is set up within the Codespace and can be run manually within the Codepsace as needed.

```
cd tf
. ./init.sh
terraform apply
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
